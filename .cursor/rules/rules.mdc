# Transition Project Guidelines

## Build & Test Commands
- Build: `yarn compile` (all) or `yarn compile:dev` (watch mode)
- Lint: `yarn lint` (all) or `yarn workspace [package-name] lint`
- Format: `yarn format` (all) or `yarn workspace [package-name] format`
- Test all: `yarn test`
- Test single file: `yarn workspace [package-name] test -t 'test description'`
- Test specific package: `yarn workspace [package-name] test`
- Setup test DB: `yarn setup-test` then `yarn migrate-test`

## Code Style
- TypeScript with strict typing, indentation 4 spaces
- Braces style: 1tbs (one true brace style) with `{` on same line
- Quotes: single quotes for strings
- Arrow functions: always use parentheses for params
- Imports: group by external, internal, relative paths with blank line between
- Errors: use explicit error handling with proper typing
- Naming: camelCase for vars/functions, PascalCase for classes/interfaces/types
- React components: functional components with hooks preferred
- Comments: JSDoc for public APIs and complex logic

## Project Structure
- Monorepo with workspaces in packages/ directory
- Module boundaries: respect package dependencies

## Workspaces
### chaire-lib-backend, chaire-lib-fronted, chaire-lib-common
General libraries and utils used in all our projects (also outside transition). Transition-only code should not go there.

### transition-backend, transition-frontend, transition-common
Code specific to Transition
