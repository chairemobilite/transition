    departureTimeSecondsSinceMidnight:
      type: number
      description: The departure time of the trip, in seconds since midnight. There is no timezone associated with the time, Transition is timezone agnostic as a scenario typically covers a single timezone and the 0 is the midnight in the agency of that scenario. The arrivalTimeSecondsSinceMidnight parameter may be provided instead.

    numberOfPolygons: 
      type: number
      description: "If the withGeojson query parameter is set to true, this determines the number of accessibility polygons that will be computed. For example, A maxTotalTravelTimeSeconds value of 60 minutes with a number of polygons of 3 implies that we will obtain three polygons: accessibility at 20 minutes, 40 minutes and 60 minutes. Defaults to 1."
      example: 3
    deltaSeconds: 
      type: number
      description: If the withGeojson query parameter is set to true, this determines the time window before and after the specified departure/arrival time within which accessibility polygons will be averaged. For example, a deltaSeconds of 15 minutes with a deltaIntervalSeconds of 5 minutes implies that the polygon area will be averaged over polygons obtained 15 minutes before, 10 minutes before, 5 minutes before, at specified time, 5 minutes after, 10 minutes after and 15 minutes after the specified departure or arrival time. Defaults to 0 seconds, ie the accessibility will be at the exact time of request.
      example: 900
    deltaIntervalSeconds:
      type: number
      description: If the withGeojson query parameter is set to true, this determines at which interval (within the time window specified in the deltaSeconds parameter) accessibility polygons will be calculated and averaged. See description for the deltaSeconds parameter. Has no effect if deltaSeconds is not set, defaults to 60.
      example: 300
    maxTotalTravelTimeSeconds: 
      type: number
      description: The maximum total travel time between origin and destination, including access, transfer and egress times. Defaults to 900 seconds (15 minutes).
      example: 900
    minWaitingTimeSeconds: 
      type: number
      description: "The minimum time to wait at a stop/station, in seconds, to cope with uncertainties in the vehicle arrival times. Suggested value: 180. Defaults to 180 seconds (3 minutes)."
      example: 180
    maxAccessEgressTravelTimeSeconds: 
      type: number
      description: Maximum time, in seconds, to reach the first stop/station in the trip, and to reach the destination from the last stop/station. Defaults to 900 seconds (15 minutes).
      example: 900
    maxTransferTravelTimeSeconds: 
      type: number
      description: Maximum time, in seconds, for each transfer between stop/station during the trip. Defaults to 900 seconds (15 minutes).
      example: 900
    walkingSpeedMps: 
      type: number
      description: Assumed walking speed, in meters per second. Defaults to 1.3888888888 m/s (5 km/h).
      example: 1.3888888888
    calculatePois:
      type: boolean
      description: Whether to calculate the POIs located in the polygon and include the count in the result. Defaults to false.
      example: true
    calculatePopulation:
      type: boolean
      description: Whether to calculate the population of the polygon and include the count in the result. Defaults to false.
