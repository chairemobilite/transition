    departureTimeSecondsSinceMidnight:
      type: number
      description: The departure time of the trip, in seconds since midnight. There is no timezone associated with the time, Transition is timezone agnostic as a scenario typically covers a single timezone and the 0 is the midnight in the agency of that scenario.

      description: "If the withGeojson query parameter is set to true, this determines the number of accessibility polygons that will be computed. For example, A maxTotalTravelTimeSeconds value of 60 minutes with a number of polygons of 3 implies that we will obtain three polygons: accessibility at 20 minutes, 40 minutes and 60 minutes."
      example: 3
    deltaSeconds: 
      type: number
      description: If the withGeojson query parameter is set to true, this determines the time window before and after the specified departure/arrival time within which accessibility polygons will be averaged. For example, a deltaSeconds of 15 minutes with a deltaIntervalSeconds of 5 minutes implies that the polygon area will be averaged over polygons obtained 15 minutes before, 10 minutes before, 5 minutes before, at specified time, 5 minutes after, 10 minutes after and 15 minutes after the specified departure or arrival time.
      example: 900
    deltaIntervalSeconds:
      type: number
      description: If the withGeojson query parameter is set to true, this determines at which interval (within the time window specified in the deltaSeconds parameter) accessilibility polygons will be calculated and averaged. See description for the deltaSeconds parameter.
      example: 300
    maxTotalTravelTimeSeconds: 
      type: number
      description: The maximum total travel time between origin and destination, including access, transfer and egress times
      example: 900
    minWaitingTimeSeconds: 
      type: number
      description: "The minimum time to wait at a stop/station, in seconds, to cope with uncertainties in the vehicle arrival times. Suggested value: 180"
      example: 180
    maxAccessEgressTravelTimeSeconds: 
      type: number
      description:  Maximum time, in seconds, to reach the first stop/station in the trip, and to reach the destination from the last stop/station.
      example: 900

      type: number
      description: Maximum time, in seconds, for each transfer between stop/station during the trip
