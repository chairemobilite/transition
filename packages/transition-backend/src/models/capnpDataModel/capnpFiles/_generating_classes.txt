# call from transition parent directory: those capnp files must match exactly the ones from trRouting!
# Because of a problem with @types/yargs 12.0.9, you need to run capnpc from outside the transition directory:

# Old command:
#yarn capnpc-js src/models/transition/capnp/*.capnp && sed -i "" 's/\.capnp/\.capnp.js/g' src/models/transition/capnp/*.capnp.js

# Sometimes, waiting for the command to terminate compiles those schema in .js
# and .d.ts directly in the source directory, doing ctrl-C once the .ts files are
# present seems to fix this. The .ts files can be moved to the parent directory

capnpc -o ts src/models/capnpDataModel/capnpFiles/*.capnp
